## Description
This project is a SVG logo generator, which allows to add up to 3 letters, choose the shape of the logo, the color of the text, and the background color.
 
## Installation
N/A
 
## Usage
To generate a logo, a user needs to open the code in integrated terminal, and run it by typing either “npm run” or “node index”. A series of questions will be prompted, inquiring about the containing text, the shape of the logo (allowing them to choose among a square, a triangle, and a circle), and both the color of the characters and the shape. Once all questions are answered, the SVG will be generated, and it will be saved in the ‘examples’ folder under 'logo.svg'.
 
## Credits
I was able to create this code thanks to the help of the TA, tutors, and old codes that were given to us as learning tools.
